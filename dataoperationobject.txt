Data:-
Data can be represented with in the class syntax by using variable.
We can define 3 types of variable with in the class syntax.
1. Static variables or class variables
2. Non-static variables or instance variables
3. Local variables

Operations:-
Operations can be represented in class by using methods.
We can define 3 types of methods within the class.
1. Static methods
2. Non-static methods
3. Class methods

Object:-
The concept of allocating memory space for non-static variables of a class in run time dynamically known as a object.
Or instance of a class is known as a object.
Instance means dynamic memory allocation.
Syntax:- referencevariablename= classname()-------------object creation statement.

After creating the object python interpretor takes the original address of the objects, create indirect
address based on the original address of the object and gives that indirect address to a variable.
The variable which is storing the indirect address of the object is known a reference variable.

The indirect address which is created by the python interpretor based on original address of the object
contains 2 parts.
1. Class name            2. Hexadecimal representation of hash code value.
